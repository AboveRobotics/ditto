Consume messages from MQTT brokers via [sources](#source-format) and send messages to MQTT brokers via 
[targets](#target-format).

## Content-type

When MQTT messages are sent in [Ditto Protocol](protocol-overview.html),
the payload should be `UTF-8` encoded strings.

If messages, which are not in Ditto Protocol, should be processed, a [payload mapping](connectivity-mapping.html) must
be configured for the connection in order to transform the messages.

## MQTT 3.1.1 properties

MQTT 3.1.1 messages have no application headers. Transmission-relevant properties are set in the
`"headers"` field as a part of [Ditto protocol messages](protocol-specification.html#dittoProtocolEnvelope) in the
payload. 

This property is supported:

* `correlation-id`: For correlating request messages and events. Twin events have the correlation IDs of
  [Twin commands](protocol-twinlive.html#twin) that produced them.

## Specific connection configuration

The common configuration for connections in [Connections > Sources](basic-connections.html#sources) and 
[Connections > Targets](basic-connections.html#targets) applies here as well. 

Following are some specifics for MQTT connections:

### Source format

For an MQTT connection:

* Source `"addresses"` are MQTT topics to subscribe to. Wildcards `+` and `#` are allowed.
* `"authorizationContext"` may _not_ contain placeholders `{%raw%}{{ header:<header-name> }}{%endraw%}` as MQTT 3.1.1
  has no application headers.
* The optional field `"qos"` sets the maximum Quality of Service to request when subscribing for messages. Its value
  can be `0` for at-most-once delivery, `1` for at-least-once delivery and `2` for exactly-once delivery.
  The default value is `2` (exactly-once).
  Support of any Quality of Service depends on the external MQTT broker; [AWS IoT][awsiot] for example does not
  acknowledge subscriptions with `qos=2`.

```json
{
  "addresses": [
    "<mqtt_topic>",
    "..."
  ],
  "authorizationContext": ["ditto:inbound-auth-subject", "..."],
  "qos": 2
}
```

Note: This example assumes that there is a valid user named `ditto:inbound-auth-subject` in Ditto.
If you want to use a user for the basic auth (from the [HTTP API](connectivity-protocol-bindings-http.html)) use the prefix `nginx:`, e.g. `nginx:ditto`.
See [Basic Authentication](basic-auth.html#authorization-context-in-devops-commands) for more information.

#### Source header mapping

MQTT 3.1.1 does not support headers in its protocol, however Ditto extracts the following headers from each consumed message:
* `mqtt.topic`: contains the MQTT topic on which a message was received 
* `mqtt.qos`: contains the MQTT QoS value of a received message
* `mqtt.retain`: contains the MQTT retain flag of a received message

These headers may be used in a source header mapping, e.g.:
```json
{
  "headerMapping": {
    "topic": "{%raw%}{{ header:mqtt.topic }}{%endraw%}",
    "the-qos": "{%raw%}{{ header:mqtt.qos }}{%endraw%}"
  }
}
```

#### Source acknowledgement handling

For MQTT 3.1.1 sources, when configuring 
[acknowledgement requests](basic-connections.html#source-acknowledgement-requests), consumed messages from the MQTT 3.1.1
broker are treated in the following way:

For Ditto acknowledgements with successful [status](protocol-specification-acks.html#combined-status-code):
* Acknowledges the received MQTT 3.1.1 message

For Ditto acknowledgements with mixed successful/failed [status](protocol-specification-acks.html#combined-status-code):
* If some of the aggregated [acknowledgements](basic-acknowledgements.html#acknowledgements-acks) require redelivery (e.g. based on a timeout):
   * based on the [specificConfig](#specific-configuration) [reconnectForDelivery](#reconnectforredelivery) either 
      * closes and reconnects the MQTT connection in order to receive unACKed QoS 1/2 messages again 
      * or simply acknowledges the received MQTT 3.1.1 message
* If none of the aggregated [acknowledgements](basic-acknowledgements.html#acknowledgements-acks) require redelivery:
   * acknowledges the received MQTT 3.1.1 message as redelivery does not make sense


### Target format

For an MQTT connection, the target address is the MQTT topic to publish events and messages to.
The target address may contain placeholders; see
[placeholders](basic-connections.html#placeholder-for-target-addresses) section for more information.

Further, `"topics"` is a list of strings, each list entry representing a subscription of
[Ditto protocol topics](protocol-specification-topic.html).

Outbound messages are published to the configured target address if one of the subjects in `"authorizationContext"`
has READ permission on the thing, which is associated with a message.

The additional field `"qos"` sets the Quality of Service with which messages are published.
Its value can be `0` for at-most-once delivery, `1` for at-least-once delivery and `2` for exactly-once delivery.
Support of any Quality of Service depends on the external MQTT broker.
The default value is `0` (at-most-once).


```json
{
  "address": "mqtt/topic/of/my/device/{%raw%}{{ thing:id }}{%endraw%}",
  "topics": [
    "_/_/things/twin/events",
    "_/_/things/live/messages"
  ],
  "authorizationContext": ["ditto:outbound-auth-subject", "..."],
  "qos": 0
}
```

#### Target header mapping

As MQTT 3.1.1 does not support headers in its protocol, a [header mapping](connectivity-header-mapping.html) is not possible to configure here.

#### Target acknowledgement handling

For MQTT 3.1.1 targets, when configuring 
[automatically issued acknowledgement labels](basic-connections.html#target-issued-acknowledgement-label), requested 
acknowledgements are produced in the following way:

Once the MQTT 3.1.1 client signals that the message was acknowledged by the MQTT 3.1.1 broker, the following information 
is mapped to the automatically created [acknowledgement](protocol-specification-acks.html#acknowledgement):
* Acknowledgement.status: 
   * will be `200`, if the message was successfully ACKed by the MQTT 3.1.1 broker or when the target has QoS 0
   * will be `503`, if the MQTT 3.1.1 broker ran into an error before an acknowledgement message was received
* Acknowledgement.value: 
   * will be missing, for status `200`
   * will contain more information, in case that an error `status` was set

### Specific Configuration

The MQTT 3.1.1 binding offers additional [specific configurations](basic-connections.html#specific-configuration) 
to apply for the used MQTT client.

Overall example JSON of the MQTT `"specificConfig"`:
```json
{
  "id": "mqtt-example-connection-123",
  "connectionType": "mqtt",
  "connectionStatus": "open",
  "failoverEnabled": true,
  "uri": "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883",
  "specificConfig": {
    "clientId": "my-awesome-mqtt-client-id",
    "reconnectForRedelivery": true,
    "cleanSession": false,
    "separatePublisherClient": true,
    "publisherId": "my-awesome-mqtt-publisher-client-id",
    "reconnectForRedeliveryDelay": "5s"
  },
  "sources": ["..."],
  "targets": ["..."]
}
```

#### clientId

Overwrites the default MQTT client id.

Default: not set - the ID of the Ditto [connection](basic-connections.html) is used as MQTT client ID. 

#### reconnectForRedelivery

Configures that the MQTT connection re-connects whenever a consumed message (via a connection source) with QoS 1 
("at least once") or 2 ("exactly once")
is processed but cannot be [acknowledged](#source-acknowledgement-handling) successfully.<br/>
That causes that the MQTT broker will re-publish the message once the connection reconnected.   
If configured to `false`, the MQTT message is simply acknowledged (`PUBACK` or `PUBREC`, `PUBREL`).

Default: `true`

Handle with care: 
* when set to `true`, incoming QoS 0 messages are lost during the reconnection phase
* when set to `true` and there is also an MQTT target configured to publish messages,
  the messages to be published during the reconnection phase are lost
   * to fix that, configure `"separatePublisherClient"` also to `true` in order to publish via another MQTT connection
* when set to `false`, MQTT messages with QoS 1 and 2 could get lost (e.g. during downtime or connection issues)

#### cleanSession

Configure the MQTT client's `cleanSession` flag.

Default: the negation of `"reconnectForRedelivery"`

#### separatePublisherClient

Configures whether to create a separate physical client and connection to the MQTT broker for publishing messages, or not. 
By default (configured true), a single Ditto connection would open 2 MQTT connections/sessions: one for subscribing and one for publishing.
If configured to `false`, the same MQTT connection/session is used both: for subscribing to messages, and for
publishing messages.

Default: `true`

#### publisherId

Configures a specific MQTT client ID for the case that `"separatePublisherClient"` is enabled.

Default: 
* if client ID is configured, `clientId` + `"p"`
* if no client ID is configured, `connectionId` + `"p"`

#### reconnectForRedeliveryDelay

Configures how long to wait before reconnecting a consumer client for redelivery when `"reconnectForRedelivery"`
and `separatePublisherClient` are both enabled. The minimum value is `1s`.

Default: `2s`

## Establishing a connection to an MQTT 3.1.1 endpoint

Ditto's [Connectivity service](architecture-services-connectivity.html) is responsible for creating new and managing
existing connections.

This can be done dynamically at runtime without the need to restart any microservice using a
[Ditto DevOps command](installation-operating.html#devops-commands).

Example: 

Connection configuration to create a new MQTT connection:

```json
{
  "id": "mqtt-example-connection-123",
  "connectionType": "mqtt",
  "connectionStatus": "open",
  "failoverEnabled": true,
  "uri": "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883",
  "sources": [
    {
      "addresses": [
        "eclipse-ditto-sandbox/#"
      ],
      "authorizationContext": ["ditto:inbound-auth-subject"],
      "qos": 0,
      "filters": []
    }
  ],
  "targets": [
    {
      "address": "eclipse-ditto-sandbox/{%raw%}{{ thing:id }}{%endraw%}",
      "topics": [
        "_/_/things/twin/events"
      ],
      "authorizationContext": ["ditto:outbound-auth-subject"],
      "qos": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Client-certificate authentication

Ditto supports certificate-based authentication for MQTT connections. Consult 
[Certificates for Transport Layer Security](connectivity-tls-certificates.html)
for how to set it up.

Here is an example MQTT connection, which checks the broker certificate and authenticates by a client certificate.

```json
{
  "id": "mqtt-example-connection-124",
  "connectionType": "mqtt",
  "connectionStatus": "open",
  "failoverEnabled": true,
  "uri": "ssl://test.mosquitto.org:8884",
  "validateCertificates": true,
  "ca": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n<test.mosquitto.org certificate>\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
  "credentials": {
    "type": "client-cert",
    "cert": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n<signed client certificate>\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
    "key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n<client private key>\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
  },
  "sources": [
    {
      "addresses": [
        "eclipse-ditto-sandbox/#"
      ],
      "authorizationContext": ["ditto:inbound-auth-subject"],
      "qos": 0,
      "filters": []
    }
  ],
  "targets": [
    {
      "address": "eclipse-ditto-sandbox/{%raw%}{{ thing:id }}{%endraw%}",
      "topics": [
        "_/_/things/twin/events"
      ],
      "authorizationContext": ["ditto:outbound-auth-subject"],
      "qos": 0
    }
  ]
}
```
