|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|

## Common errors

| **status** | Value                    |
|------------|--------------------------|
|    `400`   | Bad Format - The request could not be completed due to malformed request syntax. |
|    `401`   | Unauthorized - The request could not be completed due to missing authentication.       |
|    `403`   | Forbidden - The Policy could not be modified as the requester had insufficient permissions ('WRITE' is required).          |
|    `404`   | Not Found - The request could not be completed. The Policy with the given ID was not found in the context of the authenticated user.  |
|    `412`   | Precondition Failed - A precondition for reading or writing the (sub-)resource failed. This will happen for write requests, if you specified an If-Match or If-None-Match header, which fails the precondition check against the current ETag of the (sub-)resource.  |
|    `413`   | Request Entity Too Large - The created or modified entity is larger than the accepted limit of 100 kB.  |
|            | See [Policy Error Responses](protocol-examples-policies-errorresponses.html) for examples of other error responses. |
